{"name":"Noah Huppert","tagline":"Programmer, Student","body":"#About Me\r\nMy name is Noah Huppert. I am currently a high school student. I enjoy programming and the challenges that come with it. When asked if I know a programming language chances are the answer is going to be \"yes\" or \"sorta\". I am most familiar (in no particular order) with Java, C, C++, C#, Javascript, HTML, CSS, SCSS, SASS, Python, Ruby, and PHP. However with a healthy amount of Googling and confusing myself I can learn a language if needed(Latest example Ruby).\r\n\r\n#Contact Me\r\nIf you wish to get in contact for any reason please email `noah.programmer AT gmail DOT com`(Replace AT and DOT with the correct characters, this is to prevent spam)\r\n\r\n#Projects\r\n##Super Blocks\r\nSuper Blocks is a learning game that is meant to help children with basic math skills.
